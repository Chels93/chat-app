React Native App with Navigation

This React Native project demonstrates the use of navigation between two screens, with customization of screen backgrounds and dynamic content passed between the screens. The app also includes basic text input handling and a demonstration of a scrollable view.

Project Structure

The project contains the following files and components:

    •	App.js: The main entry point of the application that sets up navigation between two screens (Screen1 and Screen2). It also includes additional UI elements for text input, displaying text, and demonstrating a scrollable view.
    •	Screen1.js: The first screen in the app where the user can enter their name and select a background color. This screen allows the user to navigate to Screen2 with their chosen name and background color.
    •	Screen2.js: The second screen that displays a personalized welcome message to the user, using the name and background color passed from Screen1. It also updates the navigation bar title with the user’s name.
